summary: Supporting RNA-seq pipeline optimization, data integration, and collaborative research for the Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas..
---


Maintain, update, and enhance RNA-seq pipelines written in Workflow Description Language (WDL) for processing NIH Human Tumor Atlas Network data using the Terra cloud platform. Possess extensive experience designing, developing, and optimizing WDL workflows for high-throughput data analyses. Conduct preprocessing, quality control, and metadata curation of multi-omic datasets, and support data management and uploads for the Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas Data Portal in compliance with data-sharing mandates. Perform in-depth analyses of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data to advance Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas and lung chemoprevention research. Collaborate closely with PhD trainees, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty to analyze multi-omic data, and regularly contribute methods, results, figures, and text to scientific manuscripts, white papers, and grant applications.
